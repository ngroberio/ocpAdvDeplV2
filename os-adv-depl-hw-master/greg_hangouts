Hi Greg

Grzegorz Szerlomski
I am good.
How is your homework going?
Nilton Groberio
I am running on Jenkins now
and fixing the issues
maybe I have it done today or tomorrow
Grzegorz Szerlomski
I have like 90% of it ready, but I am stuck on one thing `i cannot resolve
in multitennant section there is
- Dedicated node for each Client
- admissionControl plugin sets specific limits per label (client/customer)
I have no idea how to do it
did we actually have this on the training?
Nilton Groberio
For sure we did not !
But I will do some research about it !
Can you send me what you have now ? So I can run it here also ?

I just had a call with Ian, I had been terminated, as Sabre did not provide Crossvale with contract for my services
I am thinking about continuing working on the homework anyway, as just to get accreditation
but I will talk to Ian separately about that
